# Guess the Pixel

Guess the Pixel is a simple yet engaging game that evolved from a JavaScript loops course. As I progressed, I decided to turn this learning experience into an interactive game project. The game involves guessing the pixel spacing between two cubes.

2. **Validate:** Click the "Validate" button or use the "Enter" key.
3. **Respond to Hints:** Receive hints to refine your estimate.
4. **Win the Game:** Guess correctly and win the round!

## Features

- **Life Limitation:** You have a limited number of lives per day.
